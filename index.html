                        <p>Hello world! I am Armando Silva. I am a proud Mexican American new father of two, yes two under 20mos,
                            yes I may be a little crazy, yes I follow the creed happy wife happy life,yes this is a run on
                            sentence. Now where was I?! Oh yes, I am an individual who walks to the beat of his own drum,
                            sometimes double bass, but also a person who can know his role when he needs to. I pride myself
                            in my pride. I consider myself a loyal, hard working "normal" individual. Do I believe there
                            is such thing as normal? No I don't haha but I feel I am more similiar to others than we all
                            want to think. More in the fact that I think we all have very similiar worries, hopes, insecurites
                            and egos (definitely not blind to the much craziness around us).</p>

                        <p>I have decided to jump into this adventure of coding and web development. It is certainly something
                            I have had an interest in since I have been introduced to the internet. Wondering how it works.
                            It must've taken such work, such new thinking, a curiousity, a will, a drive and courage. Yeah,
                            it had my attention. I am currently enrolled (enthralled) in UCSD Coding Bootcamp. My hopes are
                            to open up new options that will allow me to live the life I would like for my family and I.
                            My hopes are to become a bit more productive, creative, appreciated for what I can add to a team.
                            I believe I have a valuable skill set that can be very useful to any team I find myself on. I
                            try to push to be the best and push others around me to realize they are just as qualified.</p>

                        <p>I'm not quite sure where this journey is going to take me, but I'm certainly excited, anxious, nervous,
                            hopeful and hoping I'm not being naive. I do feel my efforts will dictate what is to become,
                            but that goes for every aspect of life. I truly want to make a better person of myself and hope
                            this opportunity affords me the chance to seek that in a less stressful manner. Thank you for
                            taking the time to look over this, it is appreciated. Here's to the good life!</p>
